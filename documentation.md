136532 Peter Maina: What I have Learnt.

This session covered essential Git concepts including:

    Repository Structure: Understanding local vs remote repositories.

    Staging and Commits: Using git add and git commit to track and snapshot changes.

    Branching: Creating and managing branches for isolated feature development.

    Merging vs Rebasing:

        merge: Combines branches while preserving full commit history.

        rebase: Rewrites commit history for a cleaner, linear timeline.

    Conflict Resolution: Identifying and manually resolving merge conflicts.

    Branching Strategies:

        Git Flow (feature, develop, release, hotfix)

        GitHub Flow (lightweight PR-based)

    Common Commands: git init, clone, pull, push, checkout, log, status

    Best Practices:

        Use meaningful branch names (e.g., feature/cart-api)

        Protect main branches and enforce PR reviews

        Clean commit messages using conventional format
